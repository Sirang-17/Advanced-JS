    <p>Real-Life Example of Promise.all() <br>
🎉 Situation: Planning a Birthday Party<br>

You need ALL these things before the party can start:<br>

🎂 Cake is delivered<br>

🎶 Sound system is set up<br>

🪑 Chairs are arranged<br>

You tell three different people to handle these tasks at the same time.<br>

⏳ What you do<br>

You wait until:<br>

Cake arrives ✅<br>

Sound system ready ✅<br>

Chairs arranged ✅<br>

👉 Only then the party starts.<br>

If ANY ONE fails:<br>

Cake didn’t arrive ❌<br>

👉 Party is cancelled.<br>

🔁 Mapping to Promise.all()<br>
Real Life	JavaScript<br>
Cake delivery	Promise 1<br>
Sound system	Promise 2<br>
Chairs	Promise 3<br>
Party starts	.then()<br>
Something fails	.catch()<br>
🧠 In One Line<br>

Promise.all() is like saying:<br>
“I will continue ONLY if EVERYTHING is ready.”</p>
